# backbone-command [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biggerboat/backbone-command.png)](https://travis-ci.org/biggerboat/backbone-command)

Execution of [commands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) upon event triggers.
This is build for usage with [Backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) and relies on [injector.js](https://github.com/biggerboat/injector.js)

## Install
You could just download ```backbone-command.js``` or ```backbone-command.min.js``` from the project root.

We advise you to download it using [Bower](http://http://bower.io/) instead:
```
bower install backbone-command
```
This command will automatically download all dependencies. So in this case it takes care of downloading
[injector.js](https://github.com/biggerboat/injector.js), jQuery, Backbone and Underscore for you.
